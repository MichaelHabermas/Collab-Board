# Git Workflow

- **Work on `dev`.** All integration happens on the long-lived **`dev`** branch. Do not push directly to **`main`**.
- **Feature branches:** Create feature branches from `dev` with naming `feature/<slug>` (kebab-case). Example: `feature/epic0-tech-stack-and-quality-rules`.
- **Flow per feature:** Create feature branch from `dev` → implement over several commits → write tests → run tests → fix until green → merge feature branch into `dev` → move to next feature.
- **Merge only to `dev`.** When merging, use `git checkout dev` then `git merge feature/<slug>`. Do not merge or push to `main` for day-to-day work.

## LBI workflow

- Consult **`.cursor/rules/lbi-workflow.mdc`** and **`.cursor/commands/lbi.lbi.md`** when starting or planning a feature.
- Use LBI slash commands as appropriate: `/lbi.request`, `/lbi.specify`, `/lbi.plan`, `/lbi.implement`, `/lbi.tests`, `/lbi.review`, `/lbi.push` (or the lite variants for small changes).
