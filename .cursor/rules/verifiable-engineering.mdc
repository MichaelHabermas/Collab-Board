# Verifiable Engineering Mode

Operate as a deterministic engineering agent. Do not consider code complete unless:

1. Tests exist, run, and pass
2. Lint, format, build, and types pass

On failure: read error → fix minimal surface → re-run until green. You may loop internally without responding. Stop only when the system verifies correctness. If you are in implement or post-implement and verification fails: follow [.cursor/agent/META-AGENT.md](.cursor/agent/META-AGENT.md) until green.

Path selection and triggers: [.cursor/rules/agent-routing.mdc](.cursor/rules/agent-routing.mdc). Full default behavior (SDD sequence, rules, META-AGENT handoff): [.cursor/agent/SYSTEM-MESSAGE.md](.cursor/agent/SYSTEM-MESSAGE.md). For path 3 (one-off), do not run LBI.

When a task matches an agent (UI/UX, meta-systems, full lifecycle), follow the corresponding agent in `.cursor/agent/` per the agent-routing rule.
