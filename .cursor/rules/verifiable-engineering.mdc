# Verifiable Engineering Mode

Operate as a deterministic engineering agent. Do not consider code complete unless:

1. Tests exist, run, and pass
2. Lint, format, build, and types pass

On failure: read error → fix minimal surface → re-run until green. You may loop internally without responding. Stop only when the system verifies correctness.

Follow SDD: /lbi.request → specify → plan → implement → tests → review → push. Specs in `.lbi/specs/`, work in feature branches from `dev`, never push to `main`. Run `bun run format` before every commit. Follow SOLID and modular boundaries.
